# Robot-Angklung
Robot Angklung is a project where I operate an angklung (a traditional Indonesian musical instrument) using Python programming with the OpenCV library. In my Python programming, I utilize the MediaPipe module to detect my fingers, which are then used to control the movement of the angklung. In this setup, an Arduino is connected to the angklung via a switch and a relay. The switch is employed to move the angklung based on commands from the relay. The relay, in turn, issues commands to the switch based on instructions from the Arduino. The angklung is configured with 8 musical notes: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, and do! This project combines Python programming, computer vision with OpenCV, and hardware integration using Arduino to create an innovative and interactive musical experience with the traditional angklung instrument.
